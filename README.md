Data Science Portfolio
=======

Hello!  I'm [Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-czech/8/992/202).  

As a software engineer turned data enthusiast, I've been lucky enough to work on some pretty cool projects in the last couple years and this repo contains examples of that work.  The examples within are meant to showcase the use of modern open-source tools, core computer science concepts, and systems design principles for managing/analyzing information in a distributed, polyglottic environment (they don't really do all that yet, but hopefully they will when finished!).

All of the projects contained are broken roughly into two categories, [functional](/functional) and [demonstrative](/demonstrative).  The former includes smaller, executable codebases illustrating solutions to common problems in several different programming languages while the latter includes real-world, production (but not executable) solutions used, mostly within the context of Hadoop, to process large quantities of data at [Next Big Sound](https://www.nextbigsound.com/about).
